# Weekly report 
## week 1

Not a single line of code written yet this week. Time spend on deciding subject, researching possible algorithms to implement, figuring out basic structure of the program and setting up github repository etc. for the project. Unplanned oblications, related to a time period of human life called "Ruuhkavuodet" were seriously affecting my ability to study this week. Much of the researching and reading was done in small bursts when ever I had time, so the "hours used" figure for first week is an estimate. For the Binary space partitioning and flood fill parts of the code, I'm pretty confident that I will be able to get them in working condition fairly easily. Optimization might take some time and head scratching. 

The Cellular automata is something that I have never really dabbled with, save for playing week | hours 
 ---- | ----- ready made game of life. That is the part of the program that I excpect to require most studying and time. I have a pretty clear idea about how I'm going to approach it, but I'm also excpecting there to be surprises that I haven't taken in account when implementing it. In the limited time I had to research it, I did, not stumble to any named algorithm to use. If You have any suggestions on further reading, particular algorithms, or other things to keep in mind when implementing one, I'm all ears.

I'm not completely satisfied with my progress this week, The Project specification is bit incomplete and contains some unneccesary rambling. Also I'm not completely certain that the time complexities I estimated for the algorithms are correct. I need to get back to them at a later point. For the project idea itself and the outline I have for it I'm satisfied and can't wait to get working on it.
